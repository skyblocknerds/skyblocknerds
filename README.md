## 🌐 What Is SBN?

SBN is a private Discord server where active SkyBlock players can suggest features, give feedback, and work with Hypixel’s Game Designers on ideas for updates. Think of it as a creative hub for people who care deeply about making SkyBlock better.

The environment is chill, but when it’s time to talk design, we get serious. Whether it’s item balancing, QOL improvements, or full-on feature ideas — this is the place to talk about it.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles & Structure

SBN has a few layers of roles based on experience and involvement:

- 🟣 **Grapes** — Run the show. Review apps, organize discussions, and keep things moving.
- 🟢 **Limes** — Help out with reviews and internal organization. Think of them as trusted community leads.
- 🟠 **Orange Nerds** — Long-time contributors with consistent, quality feedback.
- ⚪ **Regular Members** — New folks just getting started.

> Promotions happen based on effort, creativity, and how you work with others. No set formula.

## ✍️ How Do Suggestions Work?

- Suggestions are posted in a forum channel inside SBN.
- Other members give feedback and vote.
- If a suggestion gets enough support, it’s marked as “greenlit.”
- Designers look through greenlit suggestions, leave feedback, and possibly approve them for development.

Some of the best ideas in the game started this way.

## 🤔 FAQ Highlights

**Do I need to be late-game to apply?**  
Not at all. If you understand the game and can offer good suggestions, you're good.

**Do I need crazy stats?**  
Nope — we care way more about how you think and what you contribute.

**Can I apply if English isn’t my first language?**  
Absolutely! As long as you can explain your ideas clearly, you're welcome.

**Do I need friends in Nerds to get in?**  
Nope. Applications are open indefinitely and are reviewed fairly by Grapes and Limes.

**Why 16+ only?**  
We’ve found younger applicants often struggle with maturity or following rules. It just works better this way.
